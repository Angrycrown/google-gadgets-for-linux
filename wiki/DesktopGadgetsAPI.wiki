= Introduction =

Google Gadgets for Linux supports most part of [http://code.google.com/apis/desktop/docs/gadget_apiref.html Google Desktop Gadgets API] that originally defined by Google Desktop for Windows product, but there are some exceptions. This page lists all APIs that are not or partially supported by Google Gadgets for Linux, as well as some new APIs that are only available in GGL.


= Unsupported APIs =
APIs listed in this section are not supported by current version of GGL. Gadgets relying on these APIs won't work correctly on GGL.

== [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/searchapi.html Search APIs] ==
All APIs in [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/searchapi.html Search APIs] category are not supported by GGL. Including:
 * [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/actionsapi.html Action API]
 * [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/eventapi.html Event API]
 * [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/indexapi.html Index API]
 * [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/releasenotes-v55.html#s5 Personalization API]
 * [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/queryapi.html Query API]

== [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/gadget-googletalk_apiref.html googleTalk] ==
[http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/gadget-googletalk_apiref.html googleTalk] related APIs are not supported by GGL.

== VBScript and JScript ==
GGL only supports standard JavaScript code, though a preprocessor is used to translate some JScript grammars into standard JavaScript. For example:
 * Things like options.item(a) = b; will be translated into options.putValue(a, b);
 * if (a) {...}; else {...} will be translated into if (a) {...} else {...}

Though VBScript is not supported, VBArray and Enumerator used by Desktop Gadgets APIs are supported through some wrapper code.

== ActiveX ==
GGL obviously doesn't support loading ActiveX objects. However, in order to support some popular gadgets, GGL emulates some commonly used ActiveX objects and methods, such as:
 * Shell.Application, open and ShellExecute methods are emulated.
 * WScript.Shell, Run method is emulated.
 * Microsoft.XMLHttp
 * Microsoft.XMLDOM
 * Scripting.FileSystemObject

= Partially supported APIs =
APIs listed in this section are partially supported by current version of GGL. Gadgets relying on these APIs may work on GGL with limited functionalities.

== [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/gadget_apiref.html#object object element] ==
GGL emulates wmplayer and flash activex object with limited functionalities. Gadgets can use object element to load a video or a flash, but it may not have the same behavior than Google Desktop for Windows.
Please refer to [http://code.google.com/intl/zh-CN/apis/desktop/docs/releasenotes-v58.html#flash this article] for how to load a flash movie.
Note: flash support is supported by gtk host (ggl-gtk).
